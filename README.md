Welcome to the 'actual' first c# Minecraft like Voxel game written entirely in c# by myself (also I didn't found actual tutorials). <br>
It has many features, chunk generation, biomes, item system, an actual story, multithreading (so no performance issues), a LOT of small features/quality of life, but at the same time (after playing Undertale) 
I started to move forward with the Tale, thus making TudorTales Games, in which tries to add something that Minecraft lacks: a soul (but I still like it). <br>
What it lacks is the actual entities (I swear it's not a bug, it's a feature), which means that the story revolves around the fact that I can't use Blender (I hate Blender with a burning passion) <br>
Did I say it's free? It's free :) <br>
Also it's open source :) <br>
And if you have ideas contact me on IG;
