EXP= execution points
LOVE= Level Of Violence
EXP standing for Execution points is in reference to the way you earn EXP, by executing monsters.
LV meaning Level Of Violence is your capacity to hurt, it grows when you’ve become more used to and more skilled at execution,
aka when you’ve earned more execution points



***Finale***

After completting all the tasks you are able to finish the game. You enter a 2d scene inspired by Undertale in which the player is met with
a stronger being( peaceful) and he will judge the player based of its actions


Lost in the World: A Vivid, Emotional Finale
*"Lost in the world" by Kanye West plays*
*a new 2d-3d scene simulation plays which combines the power of computing power in order to show something like in Undertale final battle, but 
about the whole world
As you make your final decision, the world around you erupts into color: golden reds clashing with deep blues, shimmering violet storms tearing through the sky. 
The soundtrack swells, blending hauntingly beautiful piano with distorted beats—a reflection of everything fractured and everything whole.
but still a cool piano instrumental ( maybe a blame game- my remix)
The last scene is a quiet one. Whether you chose to save the world, destroy it, or leave it broken, you’re left alone with your own reflection. 
The game doesn’t tell you what happens next. It just asks: “Did you find what you were looking for?”
