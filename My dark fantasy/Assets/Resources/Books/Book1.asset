  - " \tIn the begining, humans lived in peace. But nothing lasts forever...        
    Light beamed into the world, but men and women ran towards the darkness."
  - And so,            After much thought,  ...
  - ' ...'
  - ' ...'
  - ' The king declared war.'
  - '  He did not wage war against beasts.       He did not fought against to be
    remembered.           He went for his own people.              The only way to
    regain our true freedom is only possible after the king becomes a GOD.'
  - ' For that...'
  - ' Each being must fall.'
  - ' And with each SOUL collected, He will become powerful enough to save us all.'
  - ' One single missing SOUL means the death of the whole world.'
  - ' Legends say that the one who comes back, will meet it''s end,  but save us
    all. Without him...'
  - ' Both the king and the world will fell silent.'
  - " After fighting,      we will all be free.  But he should be smiling, too.     
    Won't he be excited? Won't he be happy?                                                         
    \tHe will be free. "
