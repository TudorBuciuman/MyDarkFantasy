  title: The fight
  author: 
  pages:
  - What is the fight, you might ask, and for this you'll need to figure it out yourself.
  - 'This world is no ordinary, but it has 1 rule: Kill or be killed!'
  - It might seem crazy to fight when there is no one, but you'll figure it out.
  - To fight is to hurt others, to destroy the flesh, or to hurt the soul.
  - To fight you need to allow the desire, the humans corruper, to swallow you whole,
    to get cold as the top of a mountain, in order to get close to fight others.
  - Crazy, right? But what will you do in order to fullfill this unending desire
    to hurt others, to become soulless?...
  - Light beamed into the world, but men and women ran towards the dark
  - This was the fall of humainkind, to achieve it, you need to fight like them.
  - Are you ready?
