[Keeper: 
(A shadowy figure steps out from the darkness) 
*So, you've finally made it. Take a seat. I've been waiting for you, traveler..

...

[Keeper: 
*I am the Keeper of Voxelia, the mortal guardian of this world.
This castle... it's a place where actions come to light, 
where your intentions are weighed, and where echoes of the past resonate.

...

[Keeper: 
*The truth be told, we were the ones that let you be free, from each block you've placed,
to every decision you've had ever made.This world... 
it's a reflection of you. But from now on it will pay back..

...

[Keeper: 
*You've heard that right. Your kindness, your cruelty, your patience, determination,
your haste, courage, kindness, they all shaped the very fabric of this world. 
And now, you stand right at the crossroads of your destiny, your very own judgement..

....

[Keeper: 
*Look around you. See the monuments you've built, the lives you've touched. 
Some remember you as a hero, others as a destroyer, conquerer. 
Every action has a ripple, every choice a consequence.

...

[Keeper: 
*Few people ever got this close to such a point, of your touch. 
Until they reach this place. But it's not too late. 
*Or is it?..
*There's still a choice to be made. 
*YOU have to pay for your choices, but it can affect us All...

...

[Keeper: 
*I'm no judge, but I won't be to one to judge tonight..

[Keeper:
*But the Great King of 7 Seas, Azrath, the semi-god, 
the ruller of space and time, he is the one powerful enough to pay back your actions.

...

[Keeper:
*This night, ALL your actions will be measured, and your future, not just yours, but of the whole world will be..

[Keeper:
*Once the clock beats midnight, the Ruller will set foot in the palace and from then, you will see your Legacy
*If it was good, you might get something out of it, 
else....
*..

...

[Keeper: 
*Do you truly believe your hands are clean, traveler? Will this decision cleanse you—or condemn you further?

[Keeper:
*Did you had this in mind the moment you sinned, more specifically, in your soul?..

[King:
*What a day, you don't meet everyday the one who was supposed to Not alter the fabric of reality, but here we are..

[King:
*True power is not in what you build or destroy,
but in understanding the cost of both..

[King:
*You know those fragments of light you once took (took from my creations),
those EXP or how you called it, it was meant to represent Execution Points,
because the only way to get more was to destroy the creation, crush the soul,
and steal it's brightness..

[King:
*You need to understand the true cost in every decision you make; 
what if now was the Rapture, and you had to pay for your sins?!

...

[King:
*Exactly! But if you will remember(and I hope you will), don't forget next time to make the world better

...

[King:
*You need to understand the way I try to judge you (and I know I'm not a saint),
but I try to judge like a loving father and not from a philosophical perspective.
You make good, everything is good, you make bad, it gets back to you.
*After a lot of consideration, I came to the decision to:

(you feel your sins crawling down your spine for the first time)

[King:
*Let you choose the fate of this beautiful world.
*I see the full potential in your ways, but if you want 
to repent, there is still a way to undo your mistakes: 

[King:
*I will let you choose the outcome of this world, by giving you the reparation or oblivion curses, .
because you have to pick one:
-I will forgieve some of your sins, let you get back to your old good ways, live your life as if nothing happened,
wake up in your bed, forget this night, but now I can't bring back the dead, also your loved ones..  

[King:
*or complete WipeOut
*all your actions(building, fights, kills..) will go away 
*but your sins still won't go away, and you won't forget about them, and their souls won't forgieve you

(you feel the pressure fading away)

[King:
*But now, for the twist, I give one more option, 
different from the first two, which you can refuse, but it will pay great..

[King:
*Your human soul

...

[King:
*It's the price for the salvation of this world, but, at the end of the day, 
it's night,
but also, I'm not a true immortal, and the only way to 
break this curse from our twisted fantasy requires the purest human soul..
Also, you're the only human with a pure soul, to ever walk these Seas of gold and lava to discuss your lifestyle.. 

...

[King:
*I know, I know it is a lot to ask, because it means that you will lose the 
most powerful thing anyone can have: a soul. 
Your soul holds the power to break the most powerful curse, and bring back our hopes and dreams...

[King:
*This is still and will be the only way to trully repent, 
all your sins will be forgiven and everyone will be back,
but.. you won't be there to shake their hands..
*This is the final sacrifice, the man can have everythng, 
but everything ends when he loses his soul...

[King:
*If you agree, Your soul will ascend, illuminating the sky above Voxelia(the game uses voxels), 
and slowly revives, while your name slowly fades away from every block placed, book written,
and slowly but real, becomes a symbol of ultimate love across the world, your soul becoming 
the reason to smile in this dark world, while also losing the only way to see the flowers blooming, 
or anything in this world, but you will feel that your actions were worth it in the end..

...

[King:
*To put this in perspective, you can choose:
Reparation: The world heals slowly, the flowers might bloom, but the scars remain;
Wipeout: A blank slate, with faint echoes of the past haunting them;
Sacrifice: A restored, idyllic world, but your memory erased from history;


//else if (badActions)

[King:
*..
*go and repent. Go and don't waste my time.
*What was even your point in wasting both of out time
for a sick joke. You followed your own rules and now look 
what a mess you made, in such a beautiful, dark, twisted fantasy, 
which you took everything from and made your own dark fantasy..

[King:
*I let the fate of the world in your hands and 
this is how you pay me back?!
*Repent and then come back to discuss the your actions
