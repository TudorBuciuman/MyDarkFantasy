 
Once upon a time...
>20
 
There was a world \n without a shape.
 
A place where time \n whispered,
but did not move.
 
All that existed was \n a hollow stillness...
 
...and the echoes of \n dreams  
that had never been \n dreamed.
 
  
But one dream was \n different.
 
It broke through \n the silence.
 
A fragile spark that \n dared to take form.
 
  
This dream grew \n into a memory.
 
A memory of skies \n that had no stars...
 
...of a world waiting \n to be found.
 
 
And so, \n the story begins.
  
But not all dreams \n are kind.
 
Some dreams carry \n shadows.
 
Memories that should \n have stayed forgotten...
 
  
These shadows \n whispered secrets...
 
Of a truth buried \n deep within.
 
The dreamer's \n path was set... 
  
To walk where no one \n had walked before.

To find \n what had been lost.
  
But with every \n step forward...
 
...the dreamer \n was reminded \n of the cost. 
  
And yet,
the dreamer \n could not stop.
Not now. Not ever.
 
%
Because somewhere, \n in the distance...
Beyond the silence \n and the shadows...
A new world was waiting.
 
 
And the dream was over 
and the dreamer woke up \n from the dream. 
 
And the dreamer \n began a new dream. 
 
And the dreamer \n dreamed again, \n dreamed better. 
 
And the dreamer \n was the universe. 
 
And the dreamer \n was love.
 
You are the dreamer.
 
>20
But now, it's time to
Wake up.
