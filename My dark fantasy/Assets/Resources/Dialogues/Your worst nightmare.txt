You thought you \n could shape this world.
(Pause, faint whispers in the background)
 
>20
Instead, you shattered it.
 
>30
 
(shatter sound)
(The whispers grow louder, forming incoherent cries, then silence and then the music erupts)

Do you feel it?
The emptiness... where \n life once was.
Where flowers once bloomed..
The silence... where \n voices once sang.
Can you still hear them?
Can you hear their sound? \n their once beautiful voices..
Or you already forgot?
Who will sing their story? \n was it not good enough \n for you?
 
>30
 
(A faint, ghostly melody echoes—a broken lullaby played on distant strings.)
 
You called yourself \n a creator...
A God
>30
 
>20
But 
you became the destroyer.
 
(The screen flashes with distorted glimpses of places destroyed
 
Or you were already?..
>05
 
Did you think this world \n would forgive you?
Did you think... I would \n forgive you?
 
(The instrumental swells with tension, the fragmented voxels dissolving further into the void.)
 
There is no redemption.
No second chance.
You have taken everything.
 
(A single white voxel floats in the void—the last piece of the world. The screen focuses on it.)
 
This... is all \n that remains.
And now, even \n that... will be gone.
 
(The white voxel dissolves into nothingness. The instrumental crescendos, then abruptly cuts to silence.)
 
Erase your sins. \n Or live with the emptiness.
Orr..
Never stop \n this feeling
pure evil..
And do it again, \n and again
and again!
 
Lines of dialogue,
 
Pixels on a \n soulless screen,
Will You ever be \n punished for this? 
 
But no, you won't \n ever be satisfied :)
 
 
This is what \n you wanted, 
right?
Do you feel it?
This strange comfort...
Like the quiet before \n a storm that never comes.
 
(The mist begins to ripple faintly, as though breathing.)
 
It feels safe, \n doesn't it?
Too safe.
Like sinking into a bed \n that swallows you whole.
 
(The piano lingers on an unresolved chord as the mist grows darker. A single, distorted violin note joins—wailing softly, almost like a lament.)
 
Did you think this \n world would love you?
Even as you crushed \n its bones?
Even as you silenced \n its song?
 
(A soft wind begins to howl, carrying faint echoes of laughter and sobs, too distorted to tell them apart.)
 
The world loved you.
trusted you.
And you...
You taught everyone \n to fear.
 
(The piano plays a descending series of notes, slow and deliberate, as if mimicking the act of falling.)
 
This is your \n greatest masterpiece.
A world unmade, \n pixel by pixel.
Your "dark fantasy"
An eternity...
Of nothing.

(A faint glimmer appears in the mist—a single light, pulsing like a heartbeat. It flickers erratically as the piano and violin grow softer, almost fading.)
 
This light?
It's not hope.
It's not salvation.
It's the last breath \n of a dying world.
 
(The light begins to sputter, its pulses aligning with the piano’s final notes.)
(light splashes then dies)
 
You can leave \n it here.
Forever gasping.
Or...
 
(The word "Erase" flickers faintly on the screen. The glimmer dims further.)
 
You can end it.
>20
 
>30
Now erase this world 
and move to the next.
>50
 
Again and again
>20

This is what you wanted,
right?
 
(Two options appear: "Erase" or "Keep the Void." 
 
(waiting
But \n it's already too late \n to have a word.
 
Do you think even \n the worst can change?
Do you still think \n you can change?
>20
 
You carved your name \n in ash and blood,
And left the earth \n to mourn its breath.
No soul can bear \n the weight you've sown,
No stars will guide \n you in your death.
May judgment find \n the sinner's heart...
And silence greet \n you where you part,
And your actions \n return tenfold..
