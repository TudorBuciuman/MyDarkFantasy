The point of "To pimp a butterfly" is to explain the whole point(lore) 
of the game: A small action can affect the rest of the story, in this case,
the butterfly explains that it doesnt matter how small it is
Like Undertale, your whole interactions will count (and be saved), but
unlike Undertale, many dialogues will have the same outcome, even for different 
choices, so if you pick something bad, it won't change the dialogue, but 
in the end that choice will still matter
And I need structures
Also I need a save file
To be fair, I'm kinda lazy so I won't make Chunk updates and say trees can't
grow in a sinfull world (not a bug, but a feature :)

Also I need to use from No church in the wild:
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-believer,
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
No church in the wild.

I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture

Which points to a dark, twisted world, no morals, morality, everyone living based 
of their liking
This marks the start of the falling, in which the world breaks apart.

Hell of a life


In the end the player has access to the whole game, can create as many worlds,
the UI turned back to normal, new very cool songs, new books, ..

Also you get the options:
*Do you restore the world?(more like purify)
*Do you leave it as it is?
*Or do you let it fade, as you awaken?
And then back to Comic Sans (If Comic Sans has no lovers, then I am dead)

New idea based of To pimp a butterfly:
Once, you were caged.
Not by walls or chains.
But by doubt.
By fear.
By the voice in your head that told you to stop.

You built this world to escape.
A garden.
A prison.
A place to hide.

But the garden is withering.
The walls are crumbling.
And the only way out...
is to face yourself.

The caterpillar built its cocoon to survive.
But to live...
To truly live...
It must break free.

You are not the garden.
You are not the prison.
You are the butterfly.

Wake up..


New idea for the intro:
"A single whisper can stir the winds."
"A drop of water can reshape a stone."
"A flicker of light can shatter the dark."

"In the smallest of moments, the world begins to change."

Intro-fighting:
Once upon a time, you fought the world.
Every shadow was your enemy.
Every step was a battle.
You swung blindly, hoping to survive.
//The player doesn't know a thing about any of this, and it's meant to disorientate

Rising:
Once upon a time, you rose above.
You found strength in the chaos.
You built.
You climbed.
You believed in something more.

Searching:
Once upon a time, you searched.
Not for others.
Not for answers.
But for yourself.
In the silence, you began to remember.

Finding:

"He'll give us what we need,
but it may not be what we want"

And now what? 


In the end, you found it.
Not the world you thought you lost.
Not the answers you thought you needed.
But you found 
yourself
This whole time, what you had to search 
was yourself

Power, curage, patience, 
and most importantily,
Determination
