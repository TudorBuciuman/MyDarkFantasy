(horror sound comes - Vsauce about fear)
 
Fear gives us life.
 
Being afraid of the \n right things \n kept you alive.
It makes sense \n to be afraid 
of poisonous insects \n or hungry tigers,
but what about fear
when there is no clear \n and obvious danger?
 
What about the \n feeling you get
when something \n is just... off?
 
A doll with eyes \n too lifelike.
A smile that \n lingers too long.
A voice that \n almost sounds human,
but not quite.
 
A conversation with \n someone
who doesn't feel human. 

Fear without a cause \n is not a warning.
It's a mystery.
And we hate mysteries.
 
Your mind tries \n to make sense \n of the wrongness,
and in doing so, \n it fills in the gaps \n with possibilities.
Possibilities \n that creep.
Possibilities \n that crawl.
Possibilities \n that feel so very, \n very real.
 
That shadow figure \n in the corner of your eye?
Was it moving?
Or did your brain \n just... assume?
 
Or maybe, just maybe...
 
There was actually \n something wrong.
 
Fear lingers in silence, \n in the spaces between thoughts,
in the quiet moments \n where reason fades
and instinct \n takes control.
 
It whispers in your ear \n when you are alone.
It watches when \n you convince yourself \n no one is there.
It waits.
And waits..

And just when you think \n you have dismissed it,
it reminds you.
A flickering light.
A distant, \n echoing sound.
A door slightly more \n open than you remember.
 
Was it always \n like that?
Did something \n change?
Or was it always \n watching,
waiting for you to notice?
