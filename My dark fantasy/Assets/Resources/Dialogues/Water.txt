Why do you sink, instead of swim?
1
1
Why do you fear, what pulls you in?
1
1
It’s not the water; it’s the weight.
1
1
It’s not the depth; it’s the hate.
1
Do you fight the pull?
1
1
Or let it take you whole?
1
1
Do you rise for air?
1
1
Or embrace the undertow?
1
Or let get swallowed 
You were never meant to swim. Stay where your feet can touch.
