So I was taking a \n walk the other day
And I seen a woman,
an old woman
Pacing up and down \n the sidewalk
She seemed to be a \n bit frustrated
As if she had dropped \n something
Having a hard time \n findin' it
So after watching her \n struggle for a while
I decide to go over \n and lend a helping \n hand, you know?

"Hello, ma'am, can I \n be of any assistance?
It seems to me that \n you have lost something
I would like to help \n you find it"

She replied:
"Oh yes, you have \n lost something, 
you've lost 

your life!"
