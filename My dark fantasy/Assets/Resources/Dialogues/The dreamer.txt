The dead room is \n deserted and white...
And the fire under the \n hearth goes out in ashes...
The dreamer, next to him,\n stands stunned by fate,
With no spark in his \n sleeping eye...
And his great genius \n is almost a myth...
And no spark in his \n sleeping eye.
 
The vast plain is \n deserted and white...
Under the blue blizzard \n she groans terribly...
A wild beast, \n it tears him apart,
And the moon looks at \n him with steely eyes...
In the darkness of the night,\n a white monolith...
And the moon looks at \n him with steely eyes.
 
The shadows gather \n around him...
The human creature \n has long since perished
But the forehead, \n still proud, \n remains in the moon
Even the white room \n in the night has died... —
The human creature \n has long since perished.
 
The room is dead, \n and the dreamer is dead...
In the distance, \n terrible wolves \n are heard, hoarse,
How they bark, \n how they howl, \n how they climb, slowly,
A sinister tremor \n of the wind-choked...
And the raven screams... \n but what did he do wrong?
A chaos, the plague \n is slowly taking place.
 
The plague is great both \n in his mind and outside,
And the moon is cold \n within him, and in the sky...
And the darkness extends \n a terrible claw,
And the worlds of shadow \n even claim his forehead...
And the moon is cold within \n him, and in the sky.
 
But the ashes under the \n hearth, suddenly, flicker...
On the walls, \n blue ghosts run...
A living flame on \n the chimney bursts out,
It climbs, palpitates, \n crackles, speaks...
  
And the flame says: \n "I bring inspiration...
Listen, and sing, \n and young be again...
In the glory of \n resurrection drown the sigh...
A new hope, and full \n of love, I will be."
And the flame says: \n "I bring inspiration
And in the white room \n the vibration runs.
 
The scattering of \n snow outside disappears...
Above him is gold, \n and gold is in the horizon,
And here is the hero \n of the rare city...
His palaces are \n white phantoms,
Hiding among the leaves \n with fairy-tale fruits,
Looking into the shine \n of the clear stream.
 
But now,
the dreamer is dead.
The king is dead, \n so long live the king!
Yet in the echoes \n of his story,
In the whispers of wind \n and the dance of flames,
His spirit lives on, \n a legacy untold,
In the hearts of those \n who dare to dream,
His sword lies two thousand \n paces west of the broken sun.
 
Thus, in the silence \n of the white room,
Amidst shadows and \n echoes of the past,
New beginnings stir, \n and dreams take flight,
For even in death, \n the dreamer's light,
Burns eternal, \n in the poetry of night.
 
The stars descend, \n not cold but burning,
Their silver tears in \n the still air turning,
Each drop a memory, \n a lost refrain,
Falling like snow, \n yet carved with pain.
And through this sorrow, \n soft and dim,
The world remembers a song, \n a hymn.
 
And when the last flame \n dies at dawn,
When dreams are ash and \n the dark has gone,
A breeze will rise where \n silence grew,
Carrying a name the angels \n knew.
So though the dreamer \n sleeps in stone,
He is not gone. \n But he is not alone.
 
To reach his end, \n the dreamer walks far away,
Beyond the flowers of \n the seventh forest,
where the wind breaks \n at five thousants steps.

Now, it's time \n to wake up.
