Cold as ice, 
but not just \n frost on my skin, 
Feel the chill \n deep within, 
A heart that's seen \n the light dim. 
Frozen walls around \n my soul, 
Echoes of a life \n taking its toll. 
In the silence, 
there's a cost,
Battles fought, 
and battles lost.
 
In the shadows \n of the night, 
I seek the spark, \n a glimmer of light. 
But the cold remains, \n a constant fight, 
A testament to \n the battles \n I hide.
 
If spring can take \n the snow away,

Can it melt away all of \n our mistakes

Memories made in the \n coldest winter

Goodbye my friend, who \n I won't ever see again..
 
Cold as ice, 
yet my spirit fights, 
Against the darkness \n of the endless night. 
 
So here I stand, \n against the chill, 
With a heart \n that defies the still. 
In the frost, 
I carve my will, 
The journey of the soul, 
fulfilled.
