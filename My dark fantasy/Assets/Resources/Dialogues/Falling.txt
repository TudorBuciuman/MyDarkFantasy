//Falling
*The whole idea is that the player is depressed about the current state of the world( kinda corrupted), the soul
*Most of the sprites turn to just black a white(no gray) and the shader becomes depressive
*New cutscenes, new dialogues, new fights, but everything with a depressing tone
*The player can find new books, new builds, new ..
*The songs are slower and sadder, and ..

//new depressing music starts

Falling.

//waiting for a few moments and then closes

It doesn’t happen all at once.
//waiting a brief moment
It’s a stumble.
A missed step.
A quiet collapse beneath the weight of it all.

You thought you were strong.
You thought you could hold it together.
But even the smallest cracks…
can break the strongest foundation.

//the music stops a few seconds
Falling isn’t the end.
It’s a moment.
A chance to see the world from below.
To notice the things you missed.
To fix your mistakes.

//music intensifies
Sometimes, the ground catches you.
Sometimes, it breaks you.
But even in the fall…
something stirs.

But the garden is withering.
The walls are crumbling.
And the only way out…
is to face yourself.

The caterpillar built its cocoon to survive.
But to live…
To truly live…
It must break free.

So don't sob,
There is always tomorrow.

"I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire.
Your love is my scripture,
And let me in, through your feeling.
I burn for you,
And through that flame, I am made whole."
//meaning addiction, seeking happiness, but also desire


//a big pause
Once upon a time..

someone fell..

No one helped,
But deep down,
Even a hand meant everything...

falling
