Falling.
>30

>90

It doesn't happen \n all at once.
(waiting a brief moment

>20
It's a stumble.
A missed step.
A quiet collapse \n beneath the \n weight of it all.

>20
You thought you \n were strong.
You thought you could \n hold it together.
But even the \n smallest cracks…
can break the \n strongest foundation.

>20
(the music stops a few seconds
Falling isn't \n the end.
It's a moment.
A chance to see \n the world from below.
To notice the \n things you missed.
To fix your \n mistakes.

>20
(music intensifies
Sometimes, \n the ground catches you.
Sometimes, \n it breaks you.
But even in \n the fall…
something stirs.

>20
But the garden \n is withering.
The walls are \n crumbling.
And the only \n way out…
is to face 
yourself.
>20

>20
The caterpillar \n built its cocoon \n to survive.
But to live…
To truly live…
It must break free.

>20
So don't sob,
There is always \n tomorrow.

>20
"I live by you, \n desire
I stand by you, \n walk through the fire.
Your love is my \n scripture,
And let me in, \n through your feeling.
I burn for you,
And through that flame, \n I am made whole."
(meaning addiction, seeking happiness, but also desire

>40
(a big pause
Once upon a time..

someone fell..

No one helped,
But deep down,
Even a hand meant \n everything...
