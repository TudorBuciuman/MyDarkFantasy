And it'll be a \n long time before you'll \n ever see me again,
They want me,\n hold my head in shame
So I hold 'em on,\n holding hands in vain
Covers talkin' now \n the feds say I'm insane
A psych said I'm gonna \n fumble down along 
I got the rinks off,\n coming for the things off
I guess there's nothin' \n and I'm finna chop it's head off..
I need a little something \n to knock the edge off..
Aside from this song, \n life sucks
>10
Stomping on someone,\n with my boots
And I'll put it off,\n if we modest
And every other God \n need a goddess..
And every other star,\n couldn't guide us
It falls upon something, \n that's inside us
So I'm not gonna stop \n for my riders
Tell me where my ride is,
Tell me where my ride is..
 
And I don't like them,\n and they don't like that
They don't like that,\n and I don't want that
And it'll be a long time \n before you ever see me again
Don't worry about me,\n worry 'bout you
Worry about something,\n don't worry what I do
Hatin' mfers,\n it'll be a long time
Before \n you ever see me again,\n me again
See, I need some \n time to meditate
Naw, I'm fly,\n I need time to levitate
And I don't sound try,\n tryna' hesitate
Fumbled down,\n very late,\n you a featherweight
And I'm a heavyweight,\n and I'm very great:)
I put the everyday rocking\n in every state
Do not debate,\n you cannot cape
I must've on faith,\n getting knocked of faith
Guess it's my fate,\n guess it was written
That was somethin' ,but\n that was different
Now I'm spitting and \n everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like \n when everybody sound alike
What you sound like,\n bumpin' 'em on a round mic?
I don't even sound right,\n feelin' like I'm on the \n downright
 
And I'ma set fires
And my shit downright fire,\n from the corner buyer
And I'm alone, eh
Don't worry 'bout me,\n don't worry 'bout them
Just worry 'bout you,\n and what you gonna do
And it'll be a long time,\n before you ever see me again..
Don't worry 'bout me,\n don't worry 'bout me
Just worry 'bout you\n and maybe I do
Have a long day
And it'll be a long time\n before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me,\n just worry 'bout you
I worry 'bout something\n not we can do
And it's on me
And it'll be a long time\n before you ever see me \n again
Don't worry 'bout me,
And it'll be a long time\n before you ever see me \n again
Hey, hey
'fore you ever see me again\n me again
Hey, hey
It'll be a long time,\n before you ever see me again
Can you clap your \n hands, hands?
Clap your,\n clap your hand, hands?
Clap your,\n clap your hand, hands?
And I wanna do something,\n I wanna do something then
Can you clap your hand, hands?
 
$
Need you to clap your hands, hands
Need you to clap your hands, hands
Need you to clap your hands
Need you to clap your hands, hands
Need you to clap your hands
Need you to clap your hands, hands
Need you to clap your hands
 
So if everybody just stand now,\n and shit don't plan out
Throw your hands up,\n at least give them a handout
 
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
Wait, just need two more shows\n just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane,\n I still got it
And it's something but the problem is,\n you still not it
Or maybe if it's sicker,\n they say I'm him
Or maybe if I'm humble,\n it's not a cellphone finger
Or maybe damn, I could just blow\n my shit is thinner
Maybe I should stop being real,\n maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should know somethin' different,\n I could reconsider
Got something nothing seri'\n till the cellphone liver
And I'ma drink 'til the Sun up,\n 'til I got no more liver
And I'ma stand and deliver\n 'til they pump my liver
And I'ma spit it,\n like it get it,\n kinda self,\n but I'm fine
I'd rather live by what I live by,\n then die when I'm fine
I'm gonna stand by my self,\n 'til my very last breath
'Cause you know what?\n A coward dies a thousand deaths
And I'm proud when it's a sound,\n but now a thousand next
And I could style on you,\n something down to hell with this
You can't style on me,\n I'm out of your league
I'm liable to be a liability'
You plan to style on me,\n trying to style on me
I'm liable to be a liability,\n and my ability
I can sound like
 
Don't worry 'bout me,\n worry about you
Worry about something,\n something will do
And mfers,\n it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again
So don't worry about me,\n I'll be fine
I'll be up some,\n going for mine
And it'll be a long time
'Fore you ever see me again,\n me again
Don't worry 'bout me,\n worry 'bout you,\n worry 'bout you
'Fore you ever see
Don't worry about what I been up to
 
Where the fuck I'm going,\n nah, fuck you
Who the fuck is going,\n I can something don't ask
Who is asking?\n I'll put the summer on blast and
And who is lasting?
And be the last standing
Caught up on the planning
Get a better tan and
I been feeling dandy
And who can run the planet?
And all of the damage
Left on the platter
Who's soon after all,\n I guess it's a small world after all
Stunting on the Sun \n 'cause I have to ball
I run the world 'cause \n it's a small world after all...
And I'm never after y'all
I have to loss somethin' \n and I got it all
And feeling like \n you got it all?
Humble some'
Nah, not at all
 
Worry 'bout me,\n don't worry bout me,\n just worry 'bout you
And what'cha gon' do?
It'll be a long time\n before you ever see me again
There's something \n on the all out
The call out,\n somethin' on the doormat
Last summer, last fight,\n and y'all had a fall out
 
I can sense nothing to something,\n what y'all 'bout?
Bumping nothing to something,\n and everything that y'all 'bout
Y'all had your ups and downs,\n I don't fuck around
Put everything on the something,\n then you go and fuck around
Bet you felt something,\n now you feel nothing now
Y'all feelings felt something,\n y'all don't feel nothing now
Her tears dried up,\n from bumping expressionless
I was under exodus\n and learning what the lessons is
What the ebony of essences,\n the Genesis
I got the fetishes,\n something on the sedatives
One sip and then it'll \n have you look at innocence
I wish we just could take it \n back to the Book of Genesis
Before the hook is in,\n is there any point of any of this?
But understand..
 
Put hands on you,\n then put his front side,\n and put hands on you
Just turn around say for really?\n I'm done mfer
I can state something if
They worry bout me,\n just worry bout you,\n I can when I be good
And she said that
It'll be a long time,\n before you ever see me again,\n me again
Don't worry 'bout me,\n just worry 'bout you
And I'll be up now,\n what I've been up to
And it'll be a long time,\n before you ever see me again,\n me again
Don't worry 'bout me,\n don't worry 'bout them
And it'll be a long time,\n before you ever see me again,\n me again
Me again,\n me again
It'll be a long time,
before you ever see me again..
