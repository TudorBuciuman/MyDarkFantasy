"I looked into the tomb
and saw bare bones \n and said:
where is the rich or \n the poor,
the king or the soldier,
the slave or the free?..."

If I were lightning \n I would strike you,
I would drown you if \n I were water,
And I would dig you \n a deep grave
If I were a spade.
If I were a noose \n I would hang you,
If I were a sword \n I would pierce you,
I would pursue you,
And I would reach you.
But I, although \n I remain what I am,
A deep voice \n murmurs to me
That I am more \n than anything,
For I am hatred.

Give a man nothing,
And he will create \n a paradise.
 
Give a man everything,
And he will turn it \n to dust.
 
Give a man everything he \n wants, 
and at that moment,
everything is not \n everything.
 
>10
Give a man power,
and you will see his \n true nature revealed.
The weak, powerless speak \n of justice and virtue.
But once they taste \n authority, 
they become the very \n tyrants they once despised.
Man is not ruled by morals.
He is ruled by desire.
And when the opportunity \n arrises,
he will always choose \n himself over others.
...
 
>10
We are all monsters.
Some of us are just \n better at hiding it.
Man speaks of virtue, \n yet craves power.
He condemns evil, \n yet justifies his own sins.
The greatest crimes are \n not commited by villains, 
but by those who believe \n themselves righteous.
A man convinced of \n his own virtue, \n will justify any cruelty.
Nothing is easier than \n to denounce the evil doer.
Nothing is more difficult \n than to understand him.
The line between \n good and evil runs \n throught every human heart.
 
>20
You ask me what man \n needs the most.
It is not comfort, not peace
Not even happiness..
 
>20
No
Man needs meaning
He needs to suffer \n for something
To kneel for something \n greater than himself.
 
>30
Look at the world, \n it offers pleasure, \n distraction, luxury..
And yet,
The soul cries out \n louder than ever
We were not made for comfort
We were made for struggle
for conscience
for the terrifying freedom 
to choose between \n good and evil
again and again..
 
>10
The greatest tragedy of man
is not that he suffers
is that he suffers \n without understanding why
And the greatest glory \n is not in avoiding pain
but in transforming \n it into LOVE
 
>40
I tell you, that there \n is no heroism in ease
True strength is in \n forgiveness
in standing at \n the edge of despair
and whispering
"I still believe. \n I have seen the darkest
chambers of the human heart. \n I've walked 
through prisons, madness, \n even death,
and still, I say:
man is beautiful, 
because even at his \n lowest moment
he can still choose light"
that light is of salvation.
 
>20
It is not that we \n have a short time to live,
but that we waste \n much of it.
You let the hours slip \n through your fingers like dust,
and then curse the wind \n for taking them.
You are not pressed \n for time
You are bleeding \n it on distractions
on fear
on things you know \n do not matter.
Every moment you hesitate \n is theft from youself..
 
>20
But how could you live 
and have no story to tell?
 
>20
You want meaning?
Then stop hiding \n from life
Safe choices write \n empty pages
Risks create legends
The comfortable fade
The ambitious \n get remembered
If you're not \n collecting scars
you're not really living
The best stories \n come from 
those who faced \n adversity
and overcame their fears.
So..
Will you be a footnote,
or the title chapter?
 
>30
You cannot silence \n the truth
by closing your eyes!
You cannot stop \n the stars from moving
by refusing to look up.
Light bled into the world,
But men and women \n ran towards the darkness.
 
>20
So, is it really \n wrong to dream?
Is it really wrong \n to seek a life beyond \n the limits placed upon us?
Why is it right to accept \n a world that denies us \n the right to do so?
Is it really foolish \n for a slave to seek freedom?
or is it foolish to \n accept chains as doom, \n and never dare to break them?
So let the one who \n dreams of freedom \n first awaken in chains.
...
  
>30
A sword never \n kills anyone.
It is just a tool in \n the killer's hands.
Power is not \n in the weapon.
It is in the one \n who wields it.
Weak men blame fate, \n circumstance.
The strong take \n control.
They do not beg \n for mercy.
They become the ones \n who decide who lives \n and who falls.
We suffer more in \n imagination than in reality.
Fear is a lie.
It cripples men long before \n the battle even begins.
The coward dies a \n thousand deaths in his mind,
while the warior \n faces it once, \n and moves forward.
Fate leads the willing \n and drags along the reluctant.
The world does not \n care for your hesitation.
You either take control \n of your life, \n or life takes control of you.
The storm will come \n wether you are ready or not.
Will you stand firm, \n or be swept away?
...
 
>20
For me..
Death is nothing.
I have died already,
not by them, \n but by my own hand.
but to live defeated \n is worse than \n to die every day!
A man's destiny is not \n written by the gods, 
it is siezed by his own hand, \n his own determination.
Do not wait for mercy.
Mercy is a word found \n only \n in the mind of the weak.

The darker the night, \n the brighter the stars.

Though valiantly they \n fought...
Nobody could stop me, \n could they?
I had hoped this ending \n wouldn't come.
Retaliation was inevitable \n but...
I believed they could handle \n it as they always have.
My dear friends...
I am sorry.
 
I know why you are here \n but... I'm afraid \n it's too late..
Your goal is out \n of reach.
Those deaths is not \n something I take pride in...
At least anymore..
But it is a conflict \n not of our making.
But I don't know, \n I'm no mortal man.
Maybe I'm just another \n killer.

...
One thing is certain, \n however.
Your vengeance has ensured \n this war never to end.
Much more destruction will \n occur because of this day.
Such is the path you chose.
But...
Even if you chose \n differently...
The unfortunate truth \n of the matter is...

Your fate was sealed \n the moment you entered \n my kingdom.
I will rebuild.
And with the help of your SOUL, \n I will once again be free.

I suppose I have \n talked long enough.
...
I will make this quick.
No need to worry.
