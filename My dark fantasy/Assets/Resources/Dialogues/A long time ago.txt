A king wore a 
crown of gold, 
and carried a sword 
too heavy to lift.

He ruled not 
through strength, 
but through silence.

He called it peace.
But peace built 
on fear was always 
a war in disguise.

Light bled into 
the world,

But men and women 
ran towards 
the darkness.

Then...
One day...

The king 
declared war.

He did not 
wage war against 
beasts.

He did not 
fight to be 
remembered.

He turned 
against 
his own people.

When humanity 
refused to kneel,
he raised his sword,

not to defend,
but to destroy.

It was not a 
conquest.

It was a 
correction.

And so,  
the whole kingdom

no.  

...  

The whole world  
fought back.


The next day.

The next day.

...

Both the king
and the world
fell silent.

The kingdom fell.

The whole world
had been lost
in just one night.

Once again,
everything was 
taken from us.

The king decided
it was better 
to end our
suffering.

Every human 
must die.

With each soul,
He is closer
to bring hope.

It's not long 
now.

King YEEZUS 
will let us 
go.

King YEEZUS 
will give us 
hope.

King YEEZUS 
will save us
all.

You should be
smiling, too.

Aren't 
you 
excited?

Aren't
you 
happy?


You're going 
to be free.
