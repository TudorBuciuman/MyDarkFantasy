Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Rise for the good, or crumble under your sins.. 

*But nobody came

But where is everybody?

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-believer,
Who don't believe in anything?
Will they make it out alive?
No church in the wild.

We live by you, desire
I stand by you, 
walk through the fire.
Your love is our scripture,
Now let me in,

my only feeling..


Once upon a time,
you rose above.
You found strength in the chaos.
You built.
You climbed.
You believed in something more.

But at the same time,
He also rose..


Without something to believe in,
they all disappeared without a trace.

Light beamed into the world,
but men and women ran towards the darkness.
