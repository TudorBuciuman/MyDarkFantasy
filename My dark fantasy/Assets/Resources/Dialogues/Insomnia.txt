*WAKE UP!

(You slowly open your eyes)
(The sound of silence regains the world)

[Character:
*Here, before it's too late..

(Tries to grab you)

[Character:
*What do you mean you don't know me?
*Stop dragging it and do your job!

...

[Character:
*Why won't you listen, the king, the monsters,
even the humans.. (looks with a disgusted face)
they all need YOUR help...

...

[Character:
*Don't give me that face, you still have to go.
*Your soul is worth more than all of ours combined!

...

[Character:
*Oh, so now you don't know what you have to do?
*Fine, it's about the regal family,
the 4 magic keys got stollen, and the whole world is in danger..

...

[Character:
*Fine, you can sleep today, but we still need to go..
And by WE I mean YOU, but I will let you have a good sleep.
