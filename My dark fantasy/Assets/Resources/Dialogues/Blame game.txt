Let's play the blame game, \n I miss you more
Let's play the blame game \n for sure
Let's call out names, \n names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, \n names for sure..
 
I'll call you liar for short \n as a last resort \n and my first resort
You call me treacherous \n for long
At the end of it \n you know \n we both were wrong..
 
But I love to play the \n blame game, \n I miss you more
Let's play the blame \n game for sure
Let's call out names, \n names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, \n names for sure
 
"I'd rather argue \n with you than be \n with someone else"
Arguing and harvesting \n the feelings, \n I'd rather be by myself
'Til the end, \n and I call back, \n and I hang up,
and I start to blame myself
Somebody help..

Let's play the blame game,\n I love you more
Let's play the blame game \n for sure
Let's call out names, \n names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, \n names for sure
 
Even though I knew, \n you never told the truth
He was just gon' say \n whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had \n to stop asking questions
 
All of the lights, \n we were caught in the hype 
And I was satisfied \n being in love with the lie
Then who to blame, \n you to blame, \n me to blame
For the pain and it poured \n every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game, \n I love you, more
Let's play the blame game \n for sure
 
Things used to be, \n now they're not
Anything but truth \n is what we got
Disguising ourselves \n as ones forgiven
We've become cursed \n identities
 
We walk away like \n strangers in the street
Gone for eternity, \n we erased one another
So far from where we came, \n with so much of everything
How do we leave \n with nothing?
Lack of visual \n empathy equates \n the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude \n tear us entirely
I still miss you
 
Let's play the blame game, \n I miss you more
