"They want us to bow
Down to our knees
And pray to the GOD
We don't believe"
~
 
Early in the morn'
Blood on the leaves
Burn, homie, burn! \n (You, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see! \n (You, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off \n watching you die \n in vain
It's such a shame, \n they may call me crazy
They may say that \n I am losing my sanity,
But homie, you made me! \n (You, you, you, you)
Lies don't crack,
 
But, do you?

Once I finish this,\n witnesses will convey \n just what I mean
Been feelin' this way \n since I was reborn
You never \n liked us anyway, \n fuck your friendship, \n I mean it!
Came from the bottom \n of mankind
You hate me, \n don't you?
You hate my people, \n your plan is to \n terminate my culture
You're f'ckin' evil!
And this is more \n than confession
I mean, \n I might press \n the button \n just so you know 
You sabotage \n my community, 
makin' a killin'
You made me a fighter, \n emancipation of a real \n killer!
 
The deeper the wound,
The sweeter the \n lesson.
 
The sweeter the \n berry...
The bitter the truth.
 
The deeper the path,
The darker the end.
 
The darker your mind,
The harder I shoot!
 
"I said they treat \n me like an ant" 
Woi, \n we feel a whole heap \n of pain cah we mad!
All them say we're \n doomed from the start 
Remember this, \n not even Gods \n are above consequences!

When I finish this, \n if you listen, \n then surely you will agree
This plot is \n bigger than me, \n generational hatred
It's genocism, \n it's grimy, \n little justification
Excuse my language,
But f*ck you! \n no, f*ck y'all,\n that's as real as it gets
I know you hate me, \n don't you?
You hate my people, \n I can tell 'cause it's \n threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause \n your ways deceitful,
But in the end,
we are not above all..
