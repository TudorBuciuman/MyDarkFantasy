I don't wanna talk
About things \n we've gone through
Though it's \n hurting me
Now it's history
 
I've played \n all my cards
And that's what \n you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
 
The winner takes it all
The loser's \n standing small
Beside the victory
That's the destiny
 
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
 
The Gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
 
The winner takes it all 
The loser has to fall 
It's simple and it's plain 
Why should complain? 
 
Somewhere deep inside
You must know they miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed
 
The judges will decide 
The likes of me abide 
Spectators of the show 
Always staying low 
 
The game is on again
 
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
 
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to \n shake my hand
 
I apologize
If it makes \n you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
 
But you see,
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
And so, \n the winner takes it all
 
And the loser \n has to fall
Throw the dice, \n cold as ice
Way down here, \n someone dear
Takes it all, \n has to fall
And it's plain, \n why complain?
