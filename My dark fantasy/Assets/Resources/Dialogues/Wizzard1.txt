*Welcome traveler!
{A
{A
*Your luck will run out!

*I hope you had a good day!
It was hard not to hear your       dark tale.. 
Now it's time I give you a taste   of your own medicine..
...
*You thought it would be a great   idea to come to defeat a wizzard like myself..
Well I'm no ordinary wizzard..	
After all, I was the one to seal  us from your kind..
After the great war, our people   had to runaway and hide..
And now, YOU came uninvited into  OUR world to take away our        pride..
Sinner, you belong in the depths  of hell, alongside your other     peers 
Your biggest mistake was coming   here!
And hopefully..
your last!


(You hear a strange noise from    the depths of the world)
(You feel your sins weighting     down your back)

'Tis but a scratch..

*Go and take your prayer
you'll need it!
