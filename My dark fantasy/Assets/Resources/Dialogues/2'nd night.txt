*Thought you'll come to see us..

....

[Character:
*It's fine, for now.. But it won't!
*The keys are the only thing that keeps us trapped..
*As you might know, after the war, we got sealed in
and the keys kept us trapped in here, but also help us survive from.. them.. the humans...

..

[Character:
*I know you aren't like them, but I feel like.. 
we aren't from the same from the same pea pod..
*I'm scared.. that the ones that stole the keys will unleash their true power...
everything, from the nature, mobs, to every monster, and then fight the humans..
but this time they will lose.. 

...

[Character:
*Go back to sleep. We will talk later..
