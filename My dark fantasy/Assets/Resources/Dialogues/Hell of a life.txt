Unsung martyrs are the \n executioners,
'Kneel for the ax, \n but they kiss the fur.
Move downtown, cop a \n sweet space, uh
Turn the dagger, make \n the crowd applaud,
Call the gravediggers—dig \n me a god...
She gave the bishop \n a crisis of faith,
Scarlet on his robes \n where the silk gave way.
Livin' life like we won \n the sweepstakes, what!
 
We headed to hell for \n Heaven's sakes, huh
Well, I'ma levitate, \n make the devil wait, yeah
 
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think \n we crossed the line
No more crowns for me, \n your soul is all I need
Grab my hand and we'll \n live a hell of a life

Never in your wildest dreams,\n never in your wildest dreams
In your wildest
You could hear the \n loudest screams, comin' \n from inside the screen
You a wild human
Tell me what I gotta \n do to be that guy
Runaway slaves, \n all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think \n we crossed the line,
No more crowns for me, \n your soul is all I need
Grab my hand and we'll \n live a hell of a life!

Widows weave my banners, \n orphans dig my mines,
Bishops kiss the ring, \n then I cut their tongues.
War is just a feast where \n the crows get fat,
Golden plates stacked \n with enemies' backs...
Moonlight on the moat \n that's the prophet's face,
Drownin' in the reflection \n of his own disgrace.
I'm the jury, I'm the rope, \n I'm the storm that came,
Kings don't die, they \n just change their names...

One hell of a crown! 
One hell of a life!

This is one hell of a crown! 
One hell of a crown! 
Born to burn the scrolls, \n yeah, I write in blood,
Scared to meet your God? \n Then pray to me \n that's the law!

Will your wings ever fly
Past the grips of the fire
You're one hell of a prize
That's one hell of a lie
 
>10
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think \n we crossed the line
No more fights for me, \n your soul is all I need
Grab my hand and we'll \n live a hell of a life

And got lost in a fight
Honeymoon on the dead floor
And dead \n by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life!'
