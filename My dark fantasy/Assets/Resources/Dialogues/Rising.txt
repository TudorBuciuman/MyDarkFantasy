Everybody put three \n fingers in the air
The sky is falling, \n the wind is calling
Stand for something \n or die in the morning
Rise or crumble \n under your sins! 
*But nobody came

But where is everybody?

Human beings \n in a mob
What's a mob \n to a king?
What's a king \n to a God?
What's a God to \n a non-believer,
Who don't believe \n in anything?
Will they make \n it out alive?
No church in \n the wild.

We live by you, \n desire
I stand by you, 
walk through \n the fire.
Your love is my scripture,
But now let me in, through your feeling.
my only feeling..

I burn for you,
And through that flame, I am made whole.


Once upon a time,
you rose above.
You found strength \n in the chaos.
You built.
You climbed.
You believed in \n something more.

But the bigger \n the ego,
the harder the fall!

>10

And at the same \n time,
He also rose..

Light beamed into \n the world,
@
but men and women \n ran towards \n the darkness.
@

And..
Without something \n to believe in,
they all disappeared \n without a trace..


>1

but bodies fell, \n and yet,
nobody knows the \n meaning of humanity
