Everybody put three \n fingers in the air
The sky is falling, \n the wind is calling
Stand for something \n or die in the morning
Rise or crumble \n under your sins! 
*But nobody came

But where is everybody?

Human beings \n in a mob
What's a mob \n to a king?
What's a king \n to a God?
What's a God to \n a non-believer,
Who don't believe \n in anything?
Will they make \n it out alive?
No church in \n the wild.

We live by you, \n desire
I stand by you, 
walk through \n the fire.
Your love is \n our scripture,
Now let me in,

my only feeling..


Once upon a time,
you rose above.
You found strength \n in the chaos.
You built.
You climbed.
You believed in \n something more.

But at the same \n time,
He also rose..


And..
Without something \n to believe in,
they all disappeared \n without a trace..

Light beamed into \n the world,
@
but men and women \n ran towards \n the darkness.
@

>1

one apple fell, \n and the whole world
knew the meaning \n of gravity,
but bodies fell, \n and yet,
nobody knows the \n meaning of humanity
