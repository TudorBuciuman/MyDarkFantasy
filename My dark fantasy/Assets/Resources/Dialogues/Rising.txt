For my theme song
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting \n my scream on

>20
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you \n bring home

>50

But where is everybody?
well..
F*ck every question \n you asking!

>90

They say I'm possessed, \n but it's an omen.
I've been a menace \n for the longest
But I ain't finished, \n I'm devoted
And you know it, \n and so,
The reckoning begins.

*But nobody came.

Human beings \n in a mob,
What's a mob \n to a king?
What's a king to \n a God?
What's a God to a \n non-believer,
Who don't believe \n in anything?

Will they make it \n out alive?
No church in the wild, \n no shelter tonight.

>20

We live by lust, \n by greed, by fire.
I live by you, \n desire
I stood by you,
walked through \n the pyre.
Your love was my \n scripture,
But now-let me in.
Let me drown \n in this feeling,
My only meaning.

>05

I burn for you.
Through that flame, \n I was made whole,
But the ashes fell \n too heavy,
And now I've lost \n all control.

>20

(Breakdown: Chaos)
Once upon a time,
You rose above.
You carved strength \n from the chaos.
You built. You climbed.
You believed in \n something divine.

But the bigger the ego,
The harder the fall..



>10

And at the same time, \n He also rose..
Light bled into the \n world,
But men and women \n ran towards the void.
(evident ca ma refer la towards the dark, dar m-am cam plictisit

Without a creed, \n without belief,
They disappeared \n like shadows,
Fading into nothing.


>1

And so, the bodies \n fell,
But nobody knows \n the meaning \n of a soul.

What's a God to \n a non-believer,
Who don't believe \n in anything?
Who don't believe \n in us?
