(powerful song to start the intro

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of this cursed world was all around me
So I went running for answers.

(new song

Searching.

It begins with a step.
A whisper in the silence.
A question left unanswered.

You think you're searching for the world.
For what you've lost.
For something greater.

But sometimes, it's the smallest things that matter.
A single whisper can stir the winds.
A drop of water can reshape a stone.
A flicker of light can shatter the dark.

In your search, you'll begin to see:
You're not only finding answers.
You're creating them.

But maybe..

It's already too late..

Or is it?

At the end of the day,
(dramatic light
it's night
But also,
The only way to find something
is to search for it.

In order to find,
You first need to know what you want to search

Do you know what you want to seek?

Great
Because today you won't.
But from now on,
You'll start so see the truth.
To see what was always there.

Are you ready?
Also,
I don't care,
but if you care, good for you.
