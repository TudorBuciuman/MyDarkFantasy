I remember you \n was conflicted
Misusing \n your influence
Sometimes \n I did the same
Abusing my power, \n full of resentment
Resentment that turned \n into a deep depression
I didn't wanna \n self destruct
The evils \n of this cursed world \n was all around me
So I went running \n for answers.

Early in the morn'
Blood on the leaves
Burn, homie, burn! \n (You, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see! \n (You, you, you, you)

Searching.

It begins \n with a step.
A whisper \n in the silence.
A question \n left unanswered.

You think you're \n searching for the world.
For what \n you've lost.
For something \n greater.

But sometimes, \n it's the smallest things \n that matter.
A single whisper \n can stir the winds.
A drop of water \n can reshape a stone.
A flicker of light \n can shatter the dark.

In your search, \n you'll begin to see:
You're not only \n finding answers.
You're \n creating them.

But maybe..

It's already \n too late..

Or is it?

At the end of the day,
(dramatic light
it's night
But also,
The only way \n to find something
is to search for it.
 
In order to find,
You first need \n to know what you want \n to search
 
Do you know what \n you want to seek?

Great
Because today \n you won't.
But from now on,
You'll start so \n see the truth.
To see \n what was always there.
 
Are you ready?
Also,
I don't care,
but if you care, \n good for you.
